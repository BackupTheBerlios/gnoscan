GnoScan INSTALL
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

0. REQUIREMENTS

GnoScan generally requires a Unix (-like) operating system to run, but so far
it has only been tested with Linux. I'm sure it takes a bit of fiddling around
by some skilled person to make this application run on other platforms, but I'd
like to hear your success story, just in case.

Here are the packages GnoScan depends on. They have to be available on your
system:

  - GTK+ libraries >= 1.2.7
  - Gnome libraries >= 1.2.0
  - Posix Threads (Not to worry, most systems do support them.)
  - GTK-- libraries >= 1.2.4
  - Gnome-- libraries >= 1.1.12
  - libsigc++ >= 1.0.0


1. BEFORE YOU START

You must have the gtk/gtkmm macros properly installed. If your GTK--
installation is in /usr/local then you should become user `root' now and follow
these steps:

  cd /usr/share/aclocal
  cp /usr/local/share/aclocal/*.m4 .

(Alternatively you can also place symbolic links between these files.) That
makes sure the definitions needed for autoconf are in the right place. If your
gtk/gtkmm stuff is installed in /usr then the above step should not be
necessary. If you're not sure what to do, just run the configure script and
wait for the complaints...


2. CONFIGURATION

If you have downloaded and installed a binary distribution of GnoScan, then
there is no need to read the following instructions. They only describe how to
compile GnoScan from the source files.

If you have downloaded a compressed source code archive, then please proceed
the following steps. Change to the GnoScan distribution directory (where
the INSTALL file can be found, e.g. /home/tux/gnoscan-0.1) and run

      ./configure

For a list of available options for configuration, call configure with the
--help parameter. Running configure creates a Makefile in your source code
directory. If you like, have a look at it before you continue, though this
should not be necessary, unless you want to have debugging information
included or things like that.


3. COMPILATION

After configure has successfully guessed your system's specific values, you
can compile the GnoScan source code with

      make

If you have not changed any of the predefined values for configure then
GnoScan will be installed in /usr/local/bin. Become 'root' now and run

      make install


4. INVOKING GNOSCAN

Now try it out! GnoScan can be started with

      gnoscan

on the command line. For a list of available command line options, use the
--help switch. Enjoy GnoScan!
