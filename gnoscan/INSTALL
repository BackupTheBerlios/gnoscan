GnoScan INSTALL
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

0. REQUIREMENTS

GnoScan generally requires a Unix (-like) operating system to run, but so far
it has only been tested with Linux. I'm sure it takes a bit of fiddling around
by some skilled person to make this application run on other platforms.

Here are the packages and features your system must provide in order to run
and/or compile GnoScan:

  - GTK
  - Gnome
  - Support for Posix Threads (no worries, most systems do support them)
  - GTK--
  - Gnome--

It is recommended to install these packages in the most recent versions you can
find.


1. BEFORE YOU START

You must have the gtk/gtkmm macros properly installed. If your GTK--
installation is in /usr/local then you should become user `root' now and follow
these steps:

  cd /usr/share/aclocal
  cp /usr/local/share/aclocal/*.m4 .

(Alternatively you can also place symbolic links between these files.) That
makes sure the definitions needed for autoconf are in the right place. If your
gtk/gtkmm stuff is installed in /usr then the above step should not be
necessary. If you're not sure what to do, just run the configure script and
wait for the complaints...
