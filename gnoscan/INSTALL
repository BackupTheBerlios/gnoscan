GnoScan INSTALL
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

0. REQUIREMENTS

1. BEFORE YOU START

You must have the gtk/gtkmm macros properly installed. If your GTK--
installation is in /usr/local then you should become user `root' now and follow
these steps:

  cd /usr/share/aclocal
  cp /usr/local/share/aclocal/*.m4 .

(Alternatively you can also place symbolic links between these files.) That
makes sure the definitions needed for autoconf are in the right place. If your
gtk/gtkmm stuff is installed in /usr then the above step should not be
necessary. If you're not sure what to do, just run the configure script and
wait for the complaints...
