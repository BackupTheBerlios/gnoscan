GnoScan TODO
-=-=-=-=-=-=

- Add checking for -pthreads to configure.in, though it's already checked
  by gtk-- and gnome--

- Add creation of config-files (if none exists already)

- Add netmask scanning (see feature above, otherwise it gets SLOW)

- Fix up path for the icons of the "Scan" button and the gnome-help-browser,
  i.e. make it dynamic

- Add man page and installation documents

- Implement GNU's gettext stuff
