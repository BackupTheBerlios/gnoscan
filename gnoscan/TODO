- Add creation of config-files (if none exists already)

- Report time-outs of certain ports in the result set of scan()

- Add netmask scanning (see feature above, otherwise it gets SLOW)

- Fix up path for the icons of the "Scan" button, i.e. make it dynamic

- Add man page and installation documents

- Add Posix Threads for scanning to release the pressed "Scan" button

- Implement GNU's gettext stuff
