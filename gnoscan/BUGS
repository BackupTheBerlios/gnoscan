GnoScan BUGS
-=-=-=-=-=-=

This is a list of known bugs in GnoScan. You don't have to report the problems
listed here, as I'm already working on them. However, I do appreciate any kind
of feedback on GnoScan anyway.

- The --gnoscanrc switch doesn't work properly

- The netmask scanning does not work; the settings are ignored
